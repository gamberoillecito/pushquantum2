    "Sure! Let's go step by step on how to construct the quantum circuit and evaluate it for **symmetric phase-covariant cloning**. I'll break it down into digestible steps, showing you how to set up the quantum system, define the circuit, and then calculate the cost function and perform optimization to improve the cloning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Understanding the Goal\n",
    "The goal of a **symmetric phase-covariant cloner** is to clone a quantum state of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi_\\phi \\rangle = \\cos(\\theta) |0\\rangle + \\sin(\\theta) e^{i\\phi} |0\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **single-qubit state** lying on the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere, and the phase $ \\phi $ can take any value between 0 and $ 2\\pi $. The cloner aims to generate **two identical copies** of this state with high fidelity, independent of the phase $ \\phi $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Circuit Setup\n",
    "To perform cloning on a quantum circuit, you need at least **two qubits** (one to hold the original state and one to store the copy). Let's break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input state $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $**: This is the state we want to clone. It is a single qubit in the form $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Quantum cloning machine**: This is the part where the two copies of the state are generated. A **universal phase-covariant cloner** typically uses **two qubits** as follows:\n",
    "    - The first qubit holds the original state.\n",
    "    - The second qubit holds an auxiliary state (usually $ |0\\rangle $) that will be transformed into the cloned state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You will use a combination of quantum gates (like **CNOTs**, **Hadamard**, **rotation gates**, etc.) to evolve the system into a state where the two qubits are identical copies of the input state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Quantum Circuit Structure\n",
    "We will construct the quantum circuit in stages. Here's an outline of what the quantum gates and operations will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the initial state**: The input state $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $ needs to be prepared on the first qubit. We can do this using a combination of **Hadamard** gates (to create superpositions) and **rotation gates** (to adjust the amplitudes and the phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Start with the state $ |0\\rangle $.\n",
    "    - Apply a **rotation gate** to the qubit to set it to $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $. You would use a combination of **RX** (rotation around the X-axis) and **RY** (rotation around the Y-axis) gates to create the state. The angle of rotation would depend on $ \\theta $ and $ \\phi $ to match the form of $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The goal is to create a state of the form $ \\cos(\\theta) |0\\rangle + \\sin(\\theta) e^{i\\phi} |0\\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply the cloning operations**: Use a combination of quantum gates to clone the state:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The general structure of a **phase-covariant cloner** involves entangling the two qubits (via CNOT gates, or similar gates).\n",
    "   - You need a **CNOT gate** to entangle the qubits. The control qubit will be the one holding the original state, and the target qubit will be the one that will be cloned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measure the output states**: Once the cloning is complete, you need to measure the fidelities of the output states (which correspond to the two copies of the original state) relative to the initial input state. This involves calculating the fidelity between the original state $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $ and the two output states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Calculating Fidelity\n",
    "The **fidelity** $ F_i(\\phi) $ between the cloned state $ \\rho_i $ and the original state $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_i(\\phi) = \\left( \\text{Tr}\\left( \\sqrt{ \\sqrt{\\sigma_\\phi} \\rho_i \\sqrt{\\sigma_\\phi} } \\right) \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ \\sigma_\\phi = |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle \\langle \\psi_\\phi | $ is the density matrix of the original state.\n",
    "- $ \\rho_i $ is the density matrix of the $i$-th cloned state.\n",
    "- $ F_i(\\phi) $ is the fidelity measure, which indicates how close $ \\rho_i $ is to $ |\\psi_\\phi \\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Cost Function and Optimization\n",
    "Now, letâ€™s focus on the **cost function** that you're trying to minimize. The goal is to optimize the quantum circuit to maximize the fidelity of the clones and minimize the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function for the symmetric phase-covariant cloner is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{\\text{PC}} = E\\left[ (1 - F_1(\\phi))^2 + (1 - F_2(\\phi))^2 + (F_1(\\phi) - F_2(\\phi))^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ F_1(\\phi) $ and $ F_2(\\phi) $ are the fidelities of the two output states with the original state, averaged over all values of $ \\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi] $.\n",
    "- $ E[\\cdot] $ represents the **expectation** (average) over all $ \\phi $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Using an Optimization Algorithm\n",
    "The cost function depends on the quantum circuit's parameters (the angles for rotations, etc.). To optimize the circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a classical optimization algorithm** like **Nelder-Mead**, **gradient descent**, or **Simulated Annealing**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Optimize the circuit parameters** to minimize the cost function. This means adjusting the angles for rotation gates (and any other parameters) that define your quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You would input the initial guess for the circuit parameters.\n",
    "    - For each set of parameters, run the quantum circuit to compute the output states.\n",
    "    - Calculate the fidelities $ F_1(\\phi) $ and $ F_2(\\phi) $ for each value of $ \\phi $.\n",
    "    - Compute the cost function.\n",
    "    - Update the parameters to minimize the cost function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Repeat** the process until the optimization converges, meaning the cost function is minimized and the fidelities are as high as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Final Circuit and Output\n",
    "Once the optimization has converged, you will have found the **optimal set of parameters** for the quantum circuit. These parameters represent the best configuration of your quantum cloning machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll have two output states that are as close as possible to the original state for **any** value of $ \\phi $, and your cloning machine will have optimal performance in terms of fidelity."
